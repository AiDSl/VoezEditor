<h1>Starting a new Project</h1>
In order to start a new project, the following files need to be placed into the <b>ActiveProject</b> folder:
<ul>
	<li>The audio file for the song. This should be a <b>.wav</b> file whose name starts with "song_".</li>
	<li>Optionally, a background image for the song. This should be a <b>.png</b> file whose name starts with "image_".</li>
</ul>

Note that the length of your audio file will be the length of your project's song. If you want your song to be shortened, you need to edit the file with an audio editor.
